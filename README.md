# Google-HashCode2020
This repository contains my codes of the Google Hash Code Competition, as follows: the warmup code; the qualification round code; and implementation of the Judge System to check your results automatically.

To verify the score of your solution you only need to do 2 steps:<br>
    -Replace the code "solution.py" in the "02_qualification_round" folder by your code. <br>
    -Execute the "script.sh".

The image below represents the result of my solution that is inside the "02_qualification_round" folder.

Finally, the next image represents my final result in the extended round of Hash Code 2020.<br>
As you can see, some results are different in the image above. But this only happened because the Hash Code keep all the best results.<br>
So my final score is composed of 2 different implementations and here I only shared the better one.
